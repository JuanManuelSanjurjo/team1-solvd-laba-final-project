## Checklist before merge

- [ ] Check if the commit is synced with the main branch to avoid messing up git (if the commit is behind the main branch, it should be rebased)
- [ ] Meaningful commit names and descriptions (we can also point to a issue of the project)
- [ ] No unnnecessary comments or console.logs
- [ ] JSDoc for components and functions
- [ ] Keep the functions' names meaningful
- [ ] Avoid duplicated strings (always move to constant)
- [ ] Follow the naming conventions: https://github.com/solvdinc/react-laba-international-4/blob/main/docs/naming-conventions.md
